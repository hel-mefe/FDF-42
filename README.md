# What is FDF?

FDF is a 42 Networks cursus project where you have to build a 3D/2D Wireframe Model from Scratch using Minilibx Library which is an internal Framework built and used by 42-Networks Students.

# How The Program Works ?

The program takes 1 argument as input which is the map to be Rendered, the map should end with .fdf extension as it should be fdf compilant which means the data on it organized in a way that FDF Understands to avoid all Parsing errors that could occur.
